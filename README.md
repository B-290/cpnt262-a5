## How it is made
Created a file structure. Installed express wireframe, ejs, and package.json using git init -y.
Made an api in the router for an http request. Using some help from instructor handouts and the internet created node.js functions using different methods. Using backend javascript created a server, then using fetch() on the frontend displayed the json image string.

### The client
Anyone who would like to create their own app.

## Wild life gallery
This gallery has nine images which can be common examples of pictures from the jungles; any where in the world.
